import re

# () indicates a group
# [] is a set of characters we can match for (note: \w includes _ which we don't want)
# \1 - backreference to whatever is in the group ()
# + - one or more occurences (similar to {1,})
s = re.search(r"([a-zA-Z0-9])\1+", input())
print(s.group(1)) if s else print(-1)
