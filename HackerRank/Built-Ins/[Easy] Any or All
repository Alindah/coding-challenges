_, inp = input(), input().split()
print(all([int(i) > 0 for i in inp]) and any([i == i[::-1] for i in inp]))

# Note: We can achieve mildly better time complexity if we don't use any() or all() and print False as soon as we find a negative or non-palindromic integer instead of going through the entire list.

# Time complexity: O(n) 
# Space complexity: O(n)
