from collections import Counter

_, rooms = input(), list(map(int, input().split()))
print(Counter(rooms).most_common()[-1][0])

# Time complexity: O(n lg n)
# Space complexity: O(n)


# Another solution with better runtime:

from collections import Counter

_, rooms = input(), list(map(int, input().split()))
counter = Counter(rooms)

for r in counter:
    if counter[r] == 1:
        print(r)
        
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)
